## Introduction

Sailor is a suite of Open Language Models tailored for South-East Asia (SEA), focusing on languages such as ðŸ‡®ðŸ‡©Indonesian, ðŸ‡¹ðŸ‡­Thai, ðŸ‡»ðŸ‡³Vietnamese, ðŸ‡²ðŸ‡¾Malay, and ðŸ‡±ðŸ‡¦Lao. Developed with careful data curation, Sailor models are designed to understand and generate text across diverse linguistic landscapes of SEA region. Built from Qwen 1.5, Sailor encompasses models of varying sizes, spanning from 0.5B to 7B versions for different requirements. Benchmarking results demonstrate Sailor's proficiency in tasks such as question answering, commonsense reasoning, reading comprehension and etc. in SEA languages.

- Continually pretrained on 200 Billion to 400 Billion tokens over 7 languages, including Indonesian, Thai, Vietnamese, Malay, Lao, English and Chinese.
- Various model sizes (0.5B, 1.8B, 4B and 7B) to support different requirements.
- Strong performance on SEA benchmarks such as XQuAD, TydiQA, XCOPA, Belebele and M3Exam.
- No restrict on the research and the commercial use, but should comply with the Qwen 1.5 license.
